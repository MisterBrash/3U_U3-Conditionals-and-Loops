# Unit 2 Summative - Geometry Helper üìê

##### ICS3 - Mr. Brash üêøÔ∏è


## Review

**At this point in the course we can:**
- Create a web "page" (document) using [basic HTML tags](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)
- [Style a document](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp) using basic CSS statements _in a separate CSS file_
- Connect our HTML page to JavaScript code
- Print values and text to the [console](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_console_log.asp)
- Use [variables](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_let.asp) to store and manipulate data - numbers, text ("Strings"), or booleans (`true` and `false`)
- Calculate various [Mathematics](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_math.asp) and [concatonate Strings](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/concatenating-strings-with-plus-operator) or use [Template Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_templates.asp)
- [Create our own functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp) in JavaScript to help chunk code into smaller pieces
    - Use [parameters](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_parameters.asp) and [return statements](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_return.asp) in our functions to help pass around data
- Create triggers with [event listeners](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp) and modify HTML content [using JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp)

### We've come a long way!

## Your Task (The Summative)

‚ùóHopefully you didn't miss class and your teacher was able to describe the task to you. Click on each below to see your task (read carefully).

You have 4 full class periods to complete this task (and any home time you wish to use but it is not forced). The goal is to complete Parts 1 & 2 (Level 3 & 4). If you move on to Part 3 and are successful in going "above and beyond", you will achieve an even higher level (assuming the code is clean, easy to read, etc). **A rubric is in the making and will be added when it is ready.**

### [Part 1: Geometry Functions](./TASKS/PART1.md)

### [Part 2: Quadratics](./TASKS/PART2.md)

### [Part 3: Extra](./TASKS/PART3.md)

### [Rubric](./TASKS/RUBRIC.md)

Feel free to modify the style and content of [index.html](./index.html) but you must **manage your own time wisely**. Getting lost in the CSS or similar is not a valid reason for an incomplete submission.
