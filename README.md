# Unit 3 - Conditionals and Loops

If you run into a merge conflict or an issue synchronizing with Github _try_ the following:

1. Open a terminal window by going to the menu and selecting `Terminal > New Terminal` ( the keyboard shortcut is CTRL+SHIFT+` )

So far we have the ability to chunk our code into **functions**, create webpages using **HTML**, modify the webpage using **JavaScript**, and use the **dev console** for printing and debugging.

#### 🤔 What if we need our code to _decide_ something?

> **Example:** Tell the user whether they are old enough to drive based on their age.

This is called a **_condition_**. You are permitted to drive a vehicle on the _condition_ that you meet the age requirement.

#### 🤔 How do I ask the user for a number _until_ they actually enter a number?

> **Example:** Ask the user their age but they type words, a negative value, or they enter nothing. You want to ask them again.

Repeating a section of code is called a **_loop_**. The code goes back to a certain line number and runs code _again_ **until** a certain **condition** is met.
