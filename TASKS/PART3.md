# Part 3: Extra  [Level 4+]

### Ready to reach "above and beyond"?

- Utilize your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to add images or style to the page to make it more interesting looking (appealing).  
  - We are going for _nice looking_ not gross looking. No black text on a purple background.  

- Add _more geometrical functions_ to the page: What about triangles (trig?), hexagons, or other 3-dimensional figures?  

- A very interesting challenge in grade 10 mathematics is the [shortest distance from a point to a line](https://youtu.be/7ixn0Z74hDs). Can you add a section to the page that asks the user for the slope (m) and y-intercept (b) of a line along with a point (x, y) and calculate the shortest distance from the point to the line?

- Another interesting challenge from grade 10 mathematics is the [perpendicular bisector](https://youtu.be/fDzbhdNZsSM).
